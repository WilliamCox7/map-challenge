Feel free to explore it with Chrome Developer Tools for tips.

### Rules

* No frameworks. No Angular â€“ no React. No ES6. Use plain ole Javascript.
* Each state should appear in its proper place (state images provided, see below).
* Each state on the map should react to a mouse hover.
* Clicking on a state should update _something_ on the screen showing which state was clicked.
* Don't worry about making it pretty.

The code you produce may be used on a real website, a redesign of http://teachbanzai.com. You will, therefore, be paid $100.00 for your solution, whether or not your solution is chosen.
