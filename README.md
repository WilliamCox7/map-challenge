# Map Challenge

## Task

Build a clickable map of the United States, for a browser.

## Description

This challenge is half-puzzle, half-demonstration of skill – the problem is not self-evident, and will take investigation. Generate a map of the United States using **plain** HTML, CSS, and Javascript, making each state clickable.

Here is your working example:

Feel free to explore it with Chrome Developer Tools for clues and tips for implementing your own.

### Rules

* No frameworks. No Angular – no React. No ES6. Use plain ole Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
* Each state should appear in its proper place (state images provided, see below).
* Each state on the map should react to a mouse hover.
* Clicking on a state should update _something_ on the screen showing which state was clicked.
* Don't worry about making it pretty.

The code you produce may be used on a real website, a redesign of http://teachbanzai.com. You will, therefore, be paid $100.00 for your solution, whether or not your solution is chosen.

## Help

A clickable map can be generated using a combination of `<map>` and `<area>` HTML tags ([See here.](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_area.asp)), and overlay images.

The coordinates for the map are in `states.json`, attached to this project.

Use the images provided in the `./images` directory. (Hint: You will need both `states.png` AND `map.png`. Try looking at `states.png` on a colored background.)

## Suggestion

The simpler the better. The fewer moving parts your solution has, the more attractive it will be.
